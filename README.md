I've always liked getting nicer things of objects that I use most often. I like to
use nice keyboards, for example, because I always use a keyboard. I like to use a
nice mouse for the same reason. I like having nice office supplies in general.

It is these little things in life that I use constantly, day after day, and
I like to make sure I use nice things. I'm a fan of subtle aesthetics, I guess.

I got a nicer pencil recently and it's great. When's the last time you used
a nice pencil? When's the last time you *thought* about pencils? I guess
you should be thinking about pencils now. :P
