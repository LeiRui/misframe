Have you seen the new Google Analytics UI? The home page is great!

I really like how they use questions as headings. It really helps non-experts. Another example is instead of using
 **cohort analysis**, they use **How well do you retain users?**
I didn't even know what cohort analysis was until about a year ago ðŸ˜¬.
