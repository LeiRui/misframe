*The Hacker Way* is something Mark Zuckerberg wrote about in his letter as part of Facebook's S-1 filing.
You can read it here: [S-1 Letter from Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000119312512034517/d287954ds1.htm#toc287954_10)

Here's a small part of it that I've been thinking about in the past few days:

> Hacking is also an inherently hands-on and active discipline. Instead of debating for days whether a new idea is possible or what the best way to build something is, hackers would rather just prototype something and see what works. There’s a hacker mantra that you’ll hear a lot around Facebook offices: “Code wins arguments.”

> Hacker culture is also extremely open and meritocratic. Hackers believe that the best idea and implementation should always win — not the person who is best at lobbying for an idea or the person who manages the most people.

For various reasons, I haven't written a lot of code lately. I've been thinking about ideas a lot more—mostly
about infrastructure and cloud architectures. The annoying thing about coming up with ideas and not
writing code is that it's addictive. I can think about new ideas constantly and never get
bored. It may seem productive to come up with interesting things all the time, but in reality it can be a
huge waste of time. If I'm not actually implementing anything, it doesn't matter. And most of the
time I'm not.

Fortunately, I've been working on getting back to the *Hacker Way*. Instead of just thinking and writing
about abstract topics, I've instead been *implementing things and then writing about them* like I usually do.
I've already [written something new about libab](/2017/03/13/high-availability-with-libab-health-checks-and-dns/),
and up next is a post about a stateful API service that replicates data using two-phase commit.
I also have another big project that combines those things as well as everything else I've been
working in the past several months, but I haven't really implemented much so you won't hear about it
for a while :).
