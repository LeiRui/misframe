title: The problems with not writing code

I took on a quick bug fix issue today at work as a result of a customer ticket.
I checked out the Go code, opened up Atom, and started editing the code. Then I noticed that
my entire Atom + Go environment was a mess. There were all kinds of Go analysis tools running
and filling up my screen. It was really annoying because when I use Go and Atom on my personal laptop
for all of my projects, I like to keep things minimal. But I don't remember why my work laptop
got into such a weird condition.

I wondered when the last time I actually seriously wrote some Go code on my work laptop was.
I started looking through my previous sprint assignments. The last time I had a significant
programming task as part of my sprint was... back in *late November*.

So yeah, I don't really code that much at work anymore. And that has some side effects I didn't
really expect.

What have I actually been doing? Recently...

1. Security and compliance documentation
2. Interviews
3. Sales calls
4. Legal stuff (patents)
5. Conference stuff
6. Ops and infra
7. Code reviews

A few weird and unexpected things happen when I don't write code at work.

**It gets weird to talk about what I do.** I had a hard time telling people at Percona Live what
I do at work. It's hard to give a good answer since it changes all the time.

**The way I review code changes.** I'm less strict during code reviews now. No need to annoy the people
who actually work on the code day-to-day.

**I start forgetting how stuff works.** It's hard to keep up with the code when there's lots of other
stuff going on.

**I start getting insecure during interviews.** When we interview people for our team, we're looking
for people with strong programming skills. I like to talk about their recent experience and what they've
been working on. I get insecure because if I were in their place, I'd say that I don't code much
anymore which... um... may not be a great sign. I'd wonder, "hm... maybe this person isn't a great
programmer?"

Outside of work, on the other hand, I still write a *lot* of code. So when I do think about code
or implementing something new, **I think about my own projects**. Sometimes I confuse myself because
I think about how something works at work, but then I realize that it's how my personal projects do
things and what we have at work is totally different.

I don't have an official job title but my business card (which is like 3 years old at this point)
says "Software Engineer" but that doesn't really seem accurate based on what I do day-to-day,
which changes practically every week. My job title should just be "Preetam" ðŸ˜œ .
