Exciting news! I joined [ShiftLeft](https://www.shiftleft.io/) early this month as part of the
Runtime Infrastructure team. I'm also moving to the San Francisco Bay Area. I've been busy with this
stuff and that's partly why I haven't published anything in a while.

In my new role, I want to focus on learning some specific things:

* How to grow a startup from those who have done it before.
  * Specifically: building and retaining a talented team, creating a great product, and selling it.
  * I want to start my own startup someday, and I think I'd have the highest probability of success
  by learning from the best.
* What it means to be a "Senior Engineer".
  * I've been thinking about this for years, and now I have "senior" in my title.
  I still don't know what that means, and everyone else seems to have a different take on it,
  so I guess I need to figure out my own interpretation.
* What it's like living in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Besides that, I will still be focusing on time series, monitoring, and databases, because that's what
our Runtime Infrastructure team is all about. It's really interesting to work with this stuff again in a
different setting. Some problems are the same, and some are very different :).
