I don't give a lot of advice because I think most advice depends on experience, which varies a lot.
When I do give "advice" I just share what has worked for me based on my experiences. But there's
one exception. When I started college and had almost no idea what to do<sup>1</sup>,
I<sup>2</sup> came up with some advice for myself that I thought would help me stay focused and have
the highest probability of success.

Five years later, that piece of advice has become one of my top goals because it's worked really
well for me so far. Here it is:

**Find something you like and are good at, and become the best.**

*Every day* is about figuring out how to make progress on that goal. I ask myself things like

* What do I like to do?
* Do I even like what I'm good at now?
* How do I get better? How do I become *the best?*

and so on.

Sometimes the answers change and sometimes they don't, but I always feel like I'm on the right
track. Hopefully that helps you too.

1. I decided to get a math degree and figured I'd get into finance or something.
2. OK, I'm not sure *I* came up with this myself or if someone else came up with it and shared it
with me, but... whatever. It's mine now :).
