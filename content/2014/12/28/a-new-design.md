summary: I am switching to a serif font for Misframe.
---

There used to be a period of time when I kept changing Misframe's design. I was also
changing what it was running on quite often. I spent most of my time thinking about
how it ran rather than what I was going to write. After hopping around from using WordPress,
Node.js, and Tumblr, I've landed on something so simple that I can't get distracted from
the writing.

With today's tweak, Misframe is mostly in serif. I'm using [Lora](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lora)
as the serif font and Arial for the dates and footer. Lora looks like a mix between Times and
Palatino to me. The italic "*y*" reminds me of Garamond. I guess it represents a mix of different things,
which is a trait that is shared with this blog.

I have a few posts that I'm working on right now on [Draft](https://draftin.com/). They're
not about programming. They are a bit more serious than my programming posts. I guess the
switch to serif represents a slight change of mood too.
