title: How to get over a thousand connections on LinkedIn

For a long time, I maintained my LinkedIn connections list such that I only had people that I have worked with. That's not a lot of people. Over time I started getting invitations from people I haven't worked with. I didn't see a reason to reject them (it made less sense to do that), so I connected with them. Eventually I thought, "why not add everyone?"

I started sending connection invites to everyone LinkedIn listed as people "I may know." Surprisingly enough, I think most people accepted. I didn't keep track of how many invitations I sent out, but I bet it's not too much more than how many were accepted. The whole process took about a week, and I was adding about a hundred connections a day. It doesn't take long. I probably spent less than 5 minutes a day.

What now? I'm not sure. :)
