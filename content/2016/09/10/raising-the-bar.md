I have a reputation of paying attention to detail. I'm not sure when it started.
I think I have always thought about this stuff. I have already [blogged]
(https://www.misfra.me/why-i-dont-like-to-use-my-macbook-or-windows/) about tiny
details that bother me.

Some things are a matter of preference, like how text is rendered. I like mine
rendered a certain way, especially when [hinting](https://www.misfra.me/hinting/)
is concerned. The things that aren't a matter of preference are, for example,
typos, grammar mistakes, weird formatting, etc. Those things tend to stand out to
me.

I see those problems all the time at work. They stand out the most on the website.
I've always noticed these problems, but lately I've started to actually point them
out so they can get fixed. Something I tend to forget is that things that seem
obvious to me are not always obvious to others. People tend to be focused on their
actual tasks, anyway. For the longest time I just waited for things to get fixed,
but it rarely happened.  I've started to dedicate a part of my time at work to
navigate through things and make sure things look good. If I see problems, I assume
users will too.

We use a marketing platform at work, and it's also where we also host our website.
It uses a WYSIWYG editor. The bad thing about WYSIWYG HTML editors is that people
use them. Those editors tend to produce horrible HTML; like this:

```html
<span><span><span><span><span>Content</span></span></span></span></span>
```

WYSIWYG editors also produce inline styling. This is really difficult
to maintain. If you decide to change the CSS for the site, you won't be updated
several elements that use inline styling, and you're left with inconsistencies.
Those build up.

One of the problems is that the people editing the website usually aren't
technical, so they use a WYSIWYG editor. It's probably the most productive way
to produce content, but quality tends to take a hit. Developers produce the best
code, but their time isn't well-spent putting content up on a website. So, who's
responsible for raising the bar?

I decided to start fixing stuff myself. It was inefficient for me to find a
problem, let someone else know about it, and have them fix it. This is especially
the case when problems are as trivial as a typo or a missing space. Others can use
the time that they saved to work on stuff that no one else can. I also don't have
to wait for these things to get fixed.

Who should be responsible for raising the bar? I'm not sure how other companies do
this. Is it a part of the culture? Does a single person take responsibility? I
think it would be best to make something like this a part of company culture.
I guess it conflicts a little bit with the whole startup culture of MVPs, shipping
constantly, moving fast and breaking things, etc?

When I was running a business, I made sure that whatever the user saw and experienced
was high quality. I had no idea how to make a good landing page. I had never head of
the term "landing page" either. At one point I was redesigning the thing every couple
of weeks, and that went on for a few months. Eventually I got it to a point where
I thought it looked really good. In my experience, people don't really tell you if
your site looks bad. Maybe you'll hear something if it looks good. I got lucky enough
to get some nice feedback. As an 18-year-old with absolutely no design confidence,
that felt pretty good!

### Personal Improvement

*Raising the bar* is important to me especially outside of work. That's probably
where it matters the most. I've been focusing on personal improvement since I
started college. I decided to do that early on, and I've kept it going.

I think people tend to accept too many of their flaws. A few flaws I can think of
are not being smart enough, not having the patience, or not having the time.

<div class='bigquote'>You donâ€™t find the time. You make the time.</div>

You can get smarter. You can become more patient. You can change yourself.
If you have flaws, you can work on improving them. I think it's a good habit to
make sure you're constantly improving yourself.

Keep raising the bar.
