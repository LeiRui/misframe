This was [on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11341567) a couple of weeks ago.
I think this response is great.

*What makes a senior dev?*

> Mistakes, rewrites, late nights, firefights, and deadlines.  
> Core dumps, memory leaks, hardware faults, and plain bad luck.  
> Big O, data flow, always learning -- or out you go.  
> Manager metrics, schedules hectic, methodology hegelian dialectic.  
> Taking the heat, feature creep, open office, uncomfortable seat.  
> Holy wars, revolving doors, carpal tunnel, all you can take? There's always more.  
> Fucking suits, random reboots, and the ever present "thousand language stare".  
> Oh yeah, pressure -- lots of pressure. And time, time, time.  
> Metric shitloads of time.  
> Time, man. You gotta do your fucking time.
