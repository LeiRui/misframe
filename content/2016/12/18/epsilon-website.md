Epsilon has a website! It's https://epsilon.infinitynorm.com/. I didn't want to get a
brand new domain name for it so I decided to use an existing one I've had for a while.
(You can learn about the *infinity norm* on
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_norm).)

I'm the only one using Epsilon at the moment, but as I mentioned on Twitter, I want to
run it like a Saas/DBaaS. At the very least, it would be good practice. I also miss running
a service solo :). I will open it up for others once I get comfortable with it.
