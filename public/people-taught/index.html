    <p>I started programming in 9th grade. It wasn&rsquo;t completely new to me. I knew how to make websites with simple HTML and CSS, and I knew how to code simple things like menus in Flash using Actionscript. I also spent a lot of time working with VMs, content management systems (Joomla, etc), and LAMP in middle school. I was not new to doing stuff with Bash, either.</p>

<p>I went to a magnet high school. And that fact was very clear on the first day of my computer science class (an <em>accelerated</em> CS class &ndash; I thought I had a decent background), after I got zeroes on all three quizzes. That was a shock. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I was always intimidated by that class. Everyone seemed to be ahead of me. I remember someone asked (during orientation!) what version of Java we would be using in class. I remember thinking, &ldquo;am I supposed to know about that already?!&rdquo; The only thing I knew about Java was it had a coffee mug logo. I felt like I was trying to catch up the entire time.</p>

<p>Tenth grade was a bit easier. I took AP Computer Science, and learned a lot about queues, lists, trees, and more. This is when I was taught (but didn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> understand) Big-O. By the end of APCS, I had most of the fundamentals down.</p>

<p>In 11th grade, I was supposed to take two semesters of parallel programming. The first was taught using C, and I learned about pthreads, pointers, segfaults (fun!), and all kinds of low-level goodness. My teacher, for some reason, decided to change Parallel II to &ldquo;Web Programming.&rdquo; I was a bit annoyed. Parallel II was supposed to be about running programs across multiple computers. I got over it pretty quickly, though. I liked web stuff. I was going to actually learn PHP and JavaScript!</p>

<p>It was great timing. I learned how to use JavaScript, found out about Node.js, and found MongoDB. JavaScript everywhere! And did you see how easy it was to write a web server?! WHOA! It was life-changing. I grew up thinking Apache, lighttpd, and nginx were how web servers were written, and that they were all incredibly complicated.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really glad I learned web programming that semester. The following summer I started interning at a local digital media agency doing lots of JavaScript stuff.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t take a computer science &ldquo;class&rdquo; during my senior year. It was a class dedicated to working on my tech lab project. I called it a &ldquo;Heterogeneous JavaScript-based Distributed Computing Platform&rdquo; or something like that. Basically, you take CouchDB&rsquo;s map-reduce stuff and inject it into a web browser. Yes, it was really silly :).</p>

<p>The following summer I took my Node.js-fanboy-ism over to FoundationDB where I worked on the Node.js client bindings. First (and last!) time I used C++, and I got to understand V8, libuv, and Node.js much, <em>much</em> better.</p>

<p>I learned a lot of CS in school, but I stopped taking computer science classes over three years ago. And my internships were usually only a summer long. So, did I learn everything else on my own? Am I self-taught?</p>

<p>No, I am not self-taught. I am people-taught.</p>

<p>I spent years on WebHostingTalk (I signed up on 07-13-07, but I used to lurk often) reading through posts. I saw people asking and answering questions about problems I didn&rsquo;t have, but found myself having later on. I remember opening a support ticket with my hosting provider telling them two of my hosts couldn&rsquo;t talk to each other. That&rsquo;s when I was told subnet masks actually matter :-). I have dozens of support tickets with my current provider asking what now seem to be the silliest questions. I drew diagrams and asked, &ldquo;would this work?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t take a single class on networking or Linux administration, but by now I think I have a better grasp of this stuff than anyone who learns this as an undergrad.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, it took me half a week to replace a storage engine in a database. Yeah! The fact that I was able to do it is mind-blowing, since I never really looked at a storage engine before. But it wasn&rsquo;t entirely foreign to me. Many of the concepts I used came from a couple of months at FoundationDB.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m learning a lot more from others right now than ever before. I&rsquo;m getting lots of code reviews at work, I&rsquo;m always finding excellent blog posts, videos, meetups, and conferences, and learning new things. And it&rsquo;s a lot of fun. I feel like I&rsquo;m given maps and directions from people and I just go out and explore new locations.</p>

<p>So, yeah. I&rsquo;m not self-taught. Most of the neat stuff I know most often came from someone saying, &ldquo;check this out,&rdquo; or simply mentioning it briefly. Pretty cool, right?</p>
