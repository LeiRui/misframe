  <section>
    <p>It&rsquo;s May. I have a few finals left before I can say that I&rsquo;ve completed my first year of undergrad. You could say that I&rsquo;ve changed my mind a lot about what I wanted to accomplish over these four years, but you could also say that I haven&rsquo;t. As for my major, I think I&rsquo;ve landed on something. I want to major in <em>mathematics.</em></p>

<p>I applied to the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) at UVa, also known as the E-school. To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t think about this at all. I saw &ldquo;engineering&rdquo; and marked the box, essentially. My focus was on getting in. After I was accepted, I started to think about what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to do computer science. My thought process was, if I&rsquo;m going to continue managing a web hosting company and develop cool products, I don&rsquo;t need to spend money to learn things I was already learning. For almost a decade, I&rsquo;ve been learning about technology almost exclusively from the web. I can continue doing that. So to maximize my value, I thought perhaps the commerce track was the way to go.</p>

<p>The McIntire School of Commerce was one of the major reasons why I chose UVa. It&rsquo;s the second best undergraduate business school in the nation. Since I live in Virginia, I also get in-state tuition. That sounded amazing. I did some more reading and came to the conclusion that it might be annoying to satisfy both the E-school prerequisites and those for pre-commerce, or pre-comm. I requested to transfer into the College of Arts and Sciences (CLAS), also known as the College. This was still over the summer, so I didn&rsquo;t have any issues. Eventually it was time to select courses, and I started my pre-comm trek.</p>

<p>I got really bored during my first semester. My only STEM-ish (if that makes sense) classes were statistics and astronomy. I don&rsquo;t really know how to put this. Doing problem sets for econ didn&rsquo;t seem useful. I wasn&rsquo;t interested, and I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to figure out what I was going to learn if I continued taking econ courses. I didn&rsquo;t want to keep going. I also hated writing around 25 pages about E-books for English.</p>

<p>The next semester, I took things to another level. I signed up for 12 credits worth of technical classes. Three math and a 1 credit Haskell course. People are sometimes surprised when they hear I&rsquo;m taking three math classes. It doesn&rsquo;t really make sense. They&rsquo;re still different classes, but they just happen to be in the same department. In short, I had to do a lot of math homework this semester, I got better at math, and (more importantly!) I wanted to do more math.</p>

<p>So, here I am. I want to major in math with a concentration in financial mathematics. I still have to take a couple of econ/comm courses, but that&rsquo;s fine with me. I might want to check out Wall Street if I can. I&rsquo;m still avoiding CS since I find that focusing more heavily on math will be a better investment of my time (and money) and it will complement my IT skills well.</p>

<p>So why math? I&rsquo;m bad at it. I want to get better. I&rsquo;ve never been good at math. It was my worst subject in high school. I used to say, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the point of this?&rdquo; But last year, something changed. I stopped asking that. I took a course called Advanced Math Techniques for Scientists and Engineers. It was more of a survey into different fields of math. It was a preview of what to expect. I liked it. A lot.</p>

<p>Picking a major isn&rsquo;t really a big deal for me. I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;ll do after undergrad. It&rsquo;ll probably something in IT. I&rsquo;d love to start a company, get funding, and tackle a challenging problem in the world. Anyway, I&rsquo;m not letting my major limit the scope of my future. If anything, it&rsquo;ll make it more interesting by giving me more <a href="http://misfra.me/success-potential-and-opportunity">potential</a>.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5630177">asked Hacker News</a> what I should expect in the future. I wish I got more responses, but &ldquo;it is what it is&hellip;!&rdquo; I liked this response the most:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The cool thing about IT is that a lot of people don&rsquo;t care what your major is (though admittedly there could be some &ldquo;must have degree&rdquo; at large companies). There&rsquo;s CS people, Information Technology, Infosec, Information Management, and more. There&rsquo;s not just 1 major. I worked with a Linux admin with a masters in Physics, and was entirely self taught.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of neat things you can do with a math degree in IT. Off the top of my head, anything involving statistics. Most people can&rsquo;t do any statistics at all, and the ones who can are limited. There&rsquo;s a lot in the areas of business intelligence that requires math majors. I think my company employs a few.</p>

<p>Another area is algorithms. There&rsquo;s a lot of algorithms to be had - spam filters, job schedulers, search, etc. It could be a good fit for you if you&rsquo;re into that area.</p>
