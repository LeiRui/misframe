<p>Remember my success equation? <a href="http://misfra.me/success-potential-and-opportunity">Success</a> = potential + <a href="http://misfra.me/opportunities">opportunities</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted to share my thoughts on potential. As I mentioned before, potential is <em>everywhere</em> in an academic setting. It&rsquo;s hard for me to not think about it.</p>

<h2 id="potential-is-necessary-for-success:9c9ddae6350422a2e7b5cbbff7650b5c">Potential is necessary for success.</h2>

<p>A simple example is a math test. You build up potential by studying the material, doing practice problems, and understanding key concepts. You&rsquo;re given the opportunity to succeed when you&rsquo;re given the test, and you&rsquo;ll succeed given that you had enough potential to do so. The definition of success might vary but the general principle is the same.</p>

<h2 id="potential-opens-up-opportunities:9c9ddae6350422a2e7b5cbbff7650b5c">Potential opens up opportunities.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Chance favors the prepared mind.</p>

<p>&ndash; Louis Pasteur</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whenever I think about this stuff, I remember what Joe Satriani mentioned in a video on YouTube. He says something like it&rsquo;s important for guitar players to know all of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music">modes</a>) in every key all over the guitar. He says it&rsquo;s important because once you know them and you&rsquo;re listening to some other player you can immediately go, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s Aeolian!&rdquo; or &ldquo;that&rsquo;s Phrygian dominant!&rdquo; and you get more out of listening to what the person is playing.</p>

<p>The more potential you have, the more opportunities you get. If you learn a new scale on an instrument, that&rsquo;s a whole new avenue of creativity and improvisation. If you learn a new programming language, you&rsquo;re suddenly exposed to a bunch of new opportunities like internships or projects.</p>

<p>Finding opportunities is <em>hard</em> for some. For others, it&rsquo;s a simple email away. If you want to be successful, aim to maximize your potential. Seriously, if you have enough potential, you won&rsquo;t even have to try that hard. Think of it as fishing in the ocean with a net. the bigger the net, the more fish you can capture. If your net is big enough, fish will just end up in there one way or another.</p>

<h2 id="potential-means-a-lot-of-things:9c9ddae6350422a2e7b5cbbff7650b5c">Potential means a lot of things.</h2>

<p>You build up potential in many ways, and the idea of &ldquo;potential&rdquo; is multifaceted. Just because you can pull an all-nighter to study for an exam and build up your potential for success doesn&rsquo;t mean that&rsquo;s the <em>only</em> way to do so. Getting enough rest also builds potential. Taking breaks is just as important.</p>

<h2 id="make-it-genuine:9c9ddae6350422a2e7b5cbbff7650b5c">Make it genuine.</h2>

<p>Sometimes I look back at my resume and notice that I started to learn some of the things on there when I was in elementary school. Back then, I probably didn&rsquo;t even know what a resume was. I installed my first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle">LAMP</a>) stack because I was genuinely interested and curious about how websites worked. I know it&rsquo;s tempting, but try to avoid learning things for the sake of learning them. Be genuine.</p>

<p>I asked myself in a <a href="http://misfra.me/thought-experiments">thought experiment</a> recently: &ldquo;Why do you spend hours working on a project that you don&rsquo;t get paid to work on and no one told you to do so?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m working on a <a href="https://github.com/PreetamJinka/fdbgo">Go database driver for FoundationDB</a>, and it&rsquo;s rather complicated. My answer is: I don&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s fun and I&rsquo;m learning a lot. I literally spent hours trying to figure out how this thing works. I could be watching TV shows or playing video games, but I&rsquo;m trying to solve a problem that I made for myself. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s fun, because I get frustrated and start thinking about it non-stop and it becomes an obsession. At the end of the day, I know I didn&rsquo;t waste my time even if I scrap the entire project. The knowledge (and potential) I gained by working on it make it worth it.</p>

<p>I think in college it&rsquo;s <em>very</em> easy to get sucked into thoughts like &ldquo;what am I going to do after I graduate?&rdquo; This is the time when you really have to try to commit to a major and career path. Often times people have absolutely <em>no idea</em> what to do, and it gets stressful for them. The only piece of advice I can give them is the following: &ldquo;Find something you like to do, get better at it, and do it better than anyone else.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;ll be successful that way, but hopefully you&rsquo;ll be happier along the way.</p>
