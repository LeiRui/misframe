    I first started using Observium in 2011 or 2012. I was a senior in high school. I wasn&rsquo;t that good at programming. I mean, I could write code in a few languages, knew the basic data structures, Big-O, etc. but I was not familiar with many higher level concepts like monitoring. I knew about SNMP, but I didn&rsquo;t know anything at all about the implementation. As Bitcable&rsquo;s infrastructure grew to include network switches and more hardware, I needed a monitoring tool.

    There used to be a period of time when I kept changing Misframe&rsquo;s design. I was also changing what it was running on quite often. I spent most of my time thinking about how it ran rather than what I was going to write. After hopping around from using WordPress, Node.js, and Tumblr, I&rsquo;ve landed on something so simple that I can&rsquo;t get distracted from the writing. With today&rsquo;s tweak, Misframe is mostly in serif.

    This post is more about the details of how SNMP is currently implemented in Cistern. The code at the latest commit as I write this is here. SNMP communication itself is pretty simple. There are requests and responses. PDU stands for &ldquo;protocol data unit.&rdquo; I think of them as structs. If you look in the RFCs you&rsquo;ll see them defined like this, in the ASN.1 language: GetResponse-PDU ::= [2] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE { request-id RequestID, error-status ErrorStatus, error-index ErrorIndex, variable-bindings VarBindList } That&rsquo;s a pretty dense way of describing a GetResponse.

    SNMP stands for Simple Network Management Protocol. In case you haven&rsquo;t heard, it&rsquo;s not simple. SNMP is older than me, and it&rsquo;s used everywhere in networking. I need SNMP support for Cistern. sFlow is great for statistics but it&rsquo;s not useful to get general information. You can easily get interface statistics from sFlow datagrams, but you may want to know what the interface description strings are. You may want to know which VLANs those interfaces are assigned to.

    Welcome back! In my previous post I described this interesting idea of writing a router. I had no idea whether or not it would work. I knew it was possible, of course. I run two OpenBSD routers in a failover setup with CARP (this blog is routed through them, FYI). Setup Turns out my BeagleBone Black is great for testing this out! When you plug in a factory default BeagleBone Black into a computer, it sets up a network over USB.

    So this clever new idea has been floating around in my head for a couple of days now. If you consider a router, it&rsquo;s basically connecting directing packets to different subnets. The simple case is when you have two subnets and a router that&rsquo;s in the middle. Let&rsquo;s call the router R1, with the two subnets being S1 and S2. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re managing a bunch of servers in a data center rack and they&rsquo;re all on S2.

    The original post was written last December (almost 10 months ago). To summarize, I mentioned my time series logging program, Adversaria, and I wrote about my little toy key-value store, Fickle. I wrote that I would try to add transactions, and then I ended with a goal to use it to power this blog. Since then, I wrote a skip list in C, implemented basic transactions in Go, and played around with chunks of ordered byte slices, and wrote a memory-mapped linked list.

    I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the BeagleBone Black. It&rsquo;s an alternative to the popular Raspberry Pi. I&rsquo;m such a fan that I got my second one a few days ago. This website runs on a BeagleBone Black. It&rsquo;s powered via USB, and it&rsquo;s connected to my switch at a data center. For some reason I choose to use this credit card-sized ARM computer to host stuff instead of a VM. It reminds me of the little VMs I used to work with in middle school.

    I used to subscribe to CloudLinux but then stopped. I do not use CloudLinux anymore. I&rsquo;m still getting invoiced every month even though I&rsquo;m not using my license at all. And so, every month, my balance goes up. I will not pay it. Why should I? I didn&rsquo;t use their service! It&rsquo;s too much of a hassle, in my opinion, to contact them about it. Eh. Here&rsquo;s the thing: I can&rsquo;t get another license from them unless I cough up the $42.00, right?

    I&rsquo;m going to take a simple concept, UNIX pipes, and basically frame (or misframe?) a nontrivial scenario. $ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep CPU | wc -l 4 We all know pipes, of course. You pipe stuff in and pipe stuff out. Easy enough. I think the piping in the example above is context-free. Each pipe has a stream of continuous bytes for its input and output. This is the simplest case.

    This is just my opinion. I don&rsquo;t like career fairs. I don&rsquo;t think they are of any value to me. Most people might disagree with what I have to say, and that&rsquo;s totally cool. I&rsquo;m not like most people. Career fairs are way too competitive. It&rsquo;s probably the worst place to differentiate yourself. Everyone&rsquo;s in a suit. Everyone&rsquo;s carrying around their resumes, and everyone basically gives the same rehearsed intro, right?

    I was sitting in one of my math classes the other day (how specific!) and noticed that my professor had an interesting way of writing his lowercase cursive &lsquo;f&rsquo;. You know how the bottom loop thing should go to the right? He wrote his going to the left. I thought it was weird because I thought it wasn&rsquo;t correct. Then I thought, &ldquo;wait, have I been writing my &lsquo;f&rsquo; wrong?!&rdquo; Later that day, I started doing homework for another class.

    For some reason, instead of studying for my math quiz today (it&rsquo;s past midnight right now), I decided to play around with LLVM. One of my homework exercises was to solve the Fibonacci difference equation, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n &gt;= 2, so that&rsquo;s why I wrote a recursive Fibonacci function. I think it&rsquo;s pretty cool considering I never formally learned assembly. declare i32 @printf(i8* noalias nocapture, ...) @numPrintStr = constant [27 x i8] c&quot;#%d Fibonacci number is %d\00&quot; define void @printNumber(i32 %a) { %f = call i32 @fib(i32 %a) call i32 (i8*, ...)* @printf( i8* getelementptr([27 x i8]* @numPrintStr, i32 0, i32 0), i32 %a, i32 %f) ret void } define i32 @fib(i32 %a) { entry: switch i32 %a, label %recur [ i32 1, label %base i32 2, label %base ] base: ret i32 1 recur: %prev1 = sub i32 %a, 1 %prev2 = sub i32 %a, 2 %prev1val = call i32 @fib(i32 %prev1) %prev2val = call i32 @fib(i32 %prev2) %sum = add i32 %prev1val, %prev2val ret i32 %sum } define i32 @main() { entry: call void @printNumber(i32 40) ret i32 0 } Output: $ llc fib.ll -o fib.s $ gcc fib.s -o fib $ ./fib #40 Fibonacci number is 102334155 There&rsquo;s probably a way to generate a binary without using gcc, but it&rsquo;s late and I&rsquo;m too lazy to figure it out.

    I just came back from this month&rsquo;s PyCHO meetup, and one of the things that we discussed was how to handle many simultaneous HTTP clients that send data in streams. Someone had a project, written in Python of course, that accepted large file uploads from clients, computed a hash, and sent it to S3. The goal is to do everything concurrently with minimal resource usage. I&rsquo;m not a Python programmer, but as a Go programmer this is very simple to do.

    This is the Rapid Pro pencil by Rotring. In case you don&rsquo;t know German, &ldquo;rotring&rdquo; basically means &ldquo;red ring.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve been using this pencil since March. It was the only thing I used when I was doing school work, so that basically means I used it (a lot!) for notes, homeworks, essays, etc. This one takes 0.5 mm lead, but Rotring has other versions as well, including a ballpoint. I think they should all roughly be the same.

Your natural wanderings are your compass to what’s truly interesting to you. — https://medium.com/things-ive-written/thirty-things-ive-learned-482765ee3503 I mentioned something about this before when I wrote about thought experiments.

    This is the Retrakt Pen by Karas Kustoms. It&rsquo;s machined out of aluminum and uses the popular Pilot G-2 gel refill. While this pen is made out of solid metal, machined in the US, and looks neat, it&rsquo;s not a good pen. The clip is made of stainless steel and feels quite durable. It comes with two springs (one shown here) and a spacer. The pen also accepts a Parker ballpoint refill, so that&rsquo;s what the smaller spring and spacer are for.

    I&rsquo;ve finished another summer of interning. Here are some incredibly useful &ldquo;lessons learned.&rdquo; Some of these came from hours of frustration. Some are related to others. And by the way, just because you can read this list does not mean you&rsquo;re &ldquo;learning&rdquo; these lessons. ;) Intuition is incredibly powerful. Having the right tools is the difference between trying for hours or days and failing, and getting the answer within minutes. Tools can either empower you or burden you.

    It&rsquo;s been over three weeks since my last post? Wow. I know I&rsquo;ve been throwing some thoughts around in my head (and my notebook) for a while but they&rsquo;re still only a paragraph long, I guess. They&rsquo;ll end up here eventually. Onto the good stuff. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m a workaholic. A workaholic is a person who is addicted to work. While the term generally implies that the person enjoys their work; it can also imply that they simply feel compelled to do it.

    A few months ago I was sitting in the back seat of a minivan on the way to New Jersey to visit family. I had music playing through my headphones and I was staring at a bunch of sFlow specification documents that I had downloaded onto my laptop. sFlow is a packet and counter sampling specification, and I wanted to write a decoder in Go. It&rsquo;s pretty neat to have the entire history on GitHub.

    I took a lot of notes in high school. I remember color coding stuff in freshman biology to help me memorize. Other than memorization, I didn&rsquo;t really understand the point of notes. Everyone else was doing it, so I figured I should too. I never really looked back on my notes unless I was memorizing something. I think math was the exception. I think the examples we did in class were better than what the textbooks offered, so I depended on my notes.

    I have a dedicated bagger at Kroger. Kroger&rsquo;s a grocery store, if you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with it. Whenever I go to Kroger to get groceries, the same person (probably still in high school) bags my stuff. And no, it&rsquo;s not me because I don&rsquo;t use the self-checkout ;). It all started last month&hellip; The bagger at the grocery store asked, &quot;are you from India?&quot;&#10;&#10;I think the whole wheat bread gave it away.

    (This is basically a brain dump. No revisions or drafts!) For many people, their GitHub profile is their coding portfolio. I wanted mine to be like a portfolio too. I guess you can say the same thing about Misframe. I don&rsquo;t write about everything I think about. Sometimes I let things simmer around in my head, and when I&rsquo;m not feeling lazy I just collect those thoughts together and digest it into a post.

    I started programming in 9th grade. It wasn&rsquo;t completely new to me. I knew how to make websites with simple HTML and CSS, and I knew how to code simple things like menus in Flash using Actionscript. I also spent a lot of time working with VMs, content management systems (Joomla, etc), and LAMP in middle school. I was not new to doing stuff with Bash, either. I went to a magnet high school.

    A couple of years ago, for whatever reason, I wrote a color scheme. I called it &ldquo;DarkFruit&rdquo; because it has some fruity-looking colors on a dark background. The &ldquo;LightFruit&rdquo; version has the same colors on a light background. I used it for a long time, and I got used to looking at it, but there are many things obviously wrong with it. The colors basically look randomly chosen. Comments are bright yellow and bolded, which was a little annoying.

    ARP ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. It&rsquo;s a protocol to translate network layer (layer 3) IP addresses to link layer (layer 2) MAC addresses. Why would you need this? Let&rsquo;s look at a simple example. Here we have a couple of hosts. We need them to communicate with each other and they both have IP addresses on the same subnet. They&rsquo;re connected to a layer 2 switch. We want to have communication between these two servers over TCP, which is a layer above IP.

    This post is way overdue :-/. I finished my second year at UVa early this month. Overall, it was much more different compared to the previous year. My first year was all about finding my place and what I wanted to do. That required trying lots of different things and seeing what I liked. I think it worked out well. I really like what I do these days. Confidence I think I had confidence issues last year.

    In the previous post, I wrote about inserting records into a file and keeping them ordered. The trivial solution of shifting records in a file is horrible in terms of write amplification, because we rewrite most, if not all, records on every single write that does not occur at the end. So let&rsquo;s make that better by writing to the end. In order to keep things in order, we need to know to move from the newly inserted record back to the top of the file.

    Prepending to a file is relatively expensive, but to what extent? I decided to check. I wrote 2^23 integers to a file, in ASCII, separated by a newline. On my ThinkPad with spinning rust, it takes a little longer than 12 seconds. The file size is around 31 MB. In order to &ldquo;prepend&rdquo; an integer to the beginning, we essentially have to shift all of the other elements forward and then write what we need at the beginning.

    This was an interesting use of channels in Go from today. The goal was to listen on a channel for a stream of values as they arrived one-by-one. We then had to process and batch them up in order to get them into a certain format, and then send them on another channel. The following code shows a simpler example: listening for a stream of ints and batching them into slices.

    I was at Bodo&rsquo;s one morning last week getting a bagel before work. I had a few minutes to spare because I had to wait for the bus. As I finished ordering a bagel, the lady behind the counter said, &ldquo;Smile! You&rsquo;re too young to be serious!&rdquo; I was a bit surprised. Usually people tell me that I smile a lot. Then again, it was early in the morning and I had not had my caffeine yet.

    Let&rsquo;s talk math because it&rsquo;s cool. Last year I took a course on ordinary differential equations. We were basically taught to identify different types of ordinary differential equations and use an appropriate method to solve them. Certain problems could be solved in multiple ways, but some methods are better than others. One interesting method was the application of the Laplace transform (1). The Laplace transform helps when dealing with convolutions of functions.

    This past semester was relatively more difficult for me. I decided to get all of my humanities requirements done in a single semester. I cleverly picked courses such that they each satisified at least one requirement. It was difficult, considering I had a relatively late enrollment time, but I managed to work it out. I&rsquo;m not much of a humanities guy. I have to work harder, and it&rsquo;s a bit more stressful.

    I&rsquo;m rarely going to give advice anymore. Here&rsquo;s why. It&rsquo;s sometimes unsolicited. Unsolicited advice is sometimes good and sometimes bad, both for the person giving it and the person receiving it. If someone doesn&rsquo;t ask for advice, they either don&rsquo;t need it or they don&rsquo;t know any better. Regardless, I feel like more often than not it&rsquo;s bad. They don&rsquo;t act on it and I feel like I&rsquo;ve wasted my time.

    On December 30 last year, I decided to delete my Facebook account. I was regularly deactivating my account and finally decided that I did not need it anymore. Facebook chat was one of the sources of time-wasting conversations. These conversations took up time, were generally about things I did not really care about, and I did not get a lot out of them. They unfortunately stole time that I could have used for other things.

    I gave an extremely short demo of a pair of OpenBSD routers in a redundant setup using CARP. Someone asked me afterwards why I learned about this and my answer was, essentially, because I had to. I thought it was an interesting question since I never get asked why I learned something. I learn a bunch of stuff. Why? Why learn C? It was taught in school. I had to. Why learn JavaScript?

    A long, long time ago, Misframe used to run on Wordpress. That didn&rsquo;t last very long :-). Then, in 2011, I learned enough about Node.js and CouchDB to build my first blogging &ldquo;platform&rdquo; from scratch. That was a really fun project. I essentially wrote most of it in one evening during a Thanksgiving break. Occasionally I browse through the source code to see how horrible I coded back then. Eventually it became a hassle.

    Yesterday I attended a couple of talks at this year&rsquo;s Tom Tom Founders Festival. The first was titled &ldquo;Why Charlottesville? Founding Stories,&rdquo; and the second &ldquo;Scaling Talent from a Small Town.&rdquo; I occasionally scanned the audience to see who was attending the sessions. Other than myself, I think there was only one person who looked like a student. In the second session, I didn&rsquo;t see any students. The majority of people around me were at least a decade older than me.

    A few years ago, one of the things I decided to do was to live without regret. I never say, &ldquo;I wish I had done &hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have &hellip;&rdquo; If you should have done something, why didn&rsquo;t you do it? If you, through reason, choose to do something you believe is the best choice, why would you have to regret it in the future? You did nothing wrong! If you didn&rsquo;t choose the best option, well, that&rsquo;s something to fix.

    I&rsquo;ve always liked getting nicer things of objects that I use most often. I like to use nice keyboards, for example, because I always use a keyboard. I like to use a nice mouse for the same reason. I like having nice office supplies in general. It is these little things in life that I use constantly, day after day, and I like to make sure I use nice things. I&rsquo;m a fan of subtle aesthetics, I guess.

    I&rsquo;ve just finished my first day of Fluent 2014. I&rsquo;ve talked and listened to people about jobs, careers, internships, startups, and businesses. Also, by quick observation, I think I&rsquo;m the youngest person here. It&rsquo;s pretty weird when I&rsquo;m in conversations where people talk about their jobs or careers. I haven&rsquo;t been working that long &ndash; I think I&rsquo;ve worked for a grand total of less than 2 years. I barely know what it means to have a job!

    There are at least two ways to provide atomicity and durability in databases. The first, and (I think) more common approach, is write-ahead logging. The other is shadow paging. The only system that I&rsquo;m aware of that uses shadow paging is lmdb. Write-ahead log (WAL) This is pretty easy to understand. Every transaction is first appended to a log as a set of mutations to the state. Eventually, these mutations will make their way into the primary data structure (usually some kind of B-tree).

    First off, watch this video: Bjarne Stroustrup: Why you should avoid Linked Lists. To summarize, Stroustrup states that using vectors is significantly better than using linked lists because linked lists are horrible at cache hits. (From http://daviddeley.com/programming/docs/page_faults_and_array_addressing.htm) Notice that reading sequentially from a vector means sequential reads in memory, but sequential reads from a linked list is comparable to random (bad for cache) reads in memory. How would you make a linked list faster?

    After working with C for a while, I feel like I understand C relatively less than before. I&rsquo;m going to put this in the context of my vlmap ordered map data structure. Here&rsquo;s a code snippet to start off: uint8_t* key = &quot;foo&quot;; int keylength = 3; uint8_t* val = &quot;bar&quot;; int vallength = 3; vlmap* m = vlmap_create(); vlmap_insert(m, key, keylength, val, vallength); I&rsquo;ve modified the original code for simplicity.

    I found libgc, a garbage collector library written in C, a few months ago and wanted to write something like it. The usage is really simple: replace all mallocs with gc_malloc and delete all occurrences of free in your code. Now, a few months later, I&rsquo;m thinking that it&rsquo;s not going to happen :). I&rsquo;m not giving up, but rather changing my focus. I learned some more about other garbage collectors, especially those with persistent data structures.

    How do you check if a server (an entire physical server or VM) is down? If it&rsquo;s running some sort of web server, I&rsquo;ll usually open up a browser and check if a page loads. This isn&rsquo;t very useful, since a web server process could be down but the server is still up. In that case, I try pinging it. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, I&rsquo;ll try SSHing into it. If none of those work, I am pretty sure that the entire server is down.

    (Tux says &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;) I purchased a Monoprice mechanical keyboard almost a year ago (Jan. 30). It was around $60 and has the loud, clicky Cherry MX Blue keys. It&rsquo;s on the cheaper-end of the mechanical keyboard range, but it has literally the same switches as the more expensive keyboards, like the Das Keyboard. I use laptops a lot these days (perhaps exclusively), and they all have the Apple-style chiclet keys. I don&rsquo;t have a problem with these keyboards &ndash; I&rsquo;ve been using them for around 7 years now.
