    I got an email from 123Systems about a week ago: First off, I got that email because I used to be a customer of 123Systems. I would not recommend them if you&rsquo;re looking for a reliable VPS host. I&rsquo;ve had issues with them and their support isn&rsquo;t the best. They are, however, really cheap. Read that promotion carefully &ndash; a 2 GB RAM VM for $25 per year. That&rsquo;s a little more than $2 a month.

    This past spring, I used to go to a study room in Clemons after dinner to work on problem sets. Those rooms have white boards, which I often used to check over work or write some notes as I did my homework. After I was done with my homework, I&rsquo;d start drawing trees and come up with rotation algorithms. Sure, there are algorithms out there for balanced trees, but I always got the feeling that they were really generic and hard to improve.

    Falling off the end of a function that is declared to return a value (without explicitly returning a value) leads to undefined consequences. — http://stackoverflow.com/questions/293499/what-happens-if-you-dont-return-a-value-in-c Yeah. I forgot to write a return line in a function that was supposed to return a pointer. I didn&rsquo;t notice it for days since the program worked fine &ndash; the right thing was being returned! I tried it out on my BeagleBone Black and it looked like calloc() was returning NULL.

    I guess people call these types of posts &ldquo;post mortems.&rdquo; Here we go. I got this email this morning: I generally don&rsquo;t trust alerts with 100% confidence, so I started to check on it. It was weird: it was responding to pings and establishing TCP connections, but it wouldn&rsquo;t respond to anything. SSH wouldn&rsquo;t work either. I disabled and enabled its ethernet port from the switch. It didn&rsquo;t fix it. The next step was to give it a power cycle.

    Go&rsquo;s container/heap package documentation has an example of an integer heap. Here&rsquo;s an interesting part of it: func (h *IntHeap) Push(x interface{}) { // Push and Pop use pointer receivers because they modify the slice's length, // not just its contents. *h = append(*h, x.(int)) } There&rsquo;s a little problem here. The point is, you shouldn&rsquo;t copy/paste that integer heap example into a package that you&rsquo;re going to use. The last line (ignoring the brace) has a type assertion.

    Three months ago, I started working on fickle, a key-value store written in Go. The point of this post is to just jot down some thoughts on where the project is right now and where I&rsquo;d like to take it. Adversaria This all goes back to Adversaria. It&rsquo;s that small program I wrote in Java to help me log traffic. I use it in combination with a little Flot code to make pretty graphs: It&rsquo;s really simple, which is great, but it&rsquo;s also limited.

    A friend was talking over dinner about when he was asked, during an interview, what happens when you type in a URL into an address bar in a browser. Lots of stuff happens! I&rsquo;m just going to start listing stuff. It&rsquo;s practically impossible for me to get everything, so I&rsquo;ll just do a brain dump: A DNS request over UDP to get an IP address A TCP connection gets established (SYNs and ACKs!) A GET request is created by the browser and sent over that connection Tons of different things can happen after that, including proxying, database operations, cache reads, whatever.

    When I first started Bitcable, I used to get really excited whenever I had a new order. It sounds great, right? A new customer, more revenue, getting bigger! Yay! And it was great. I thought it was perfect&hellip; until there were trouble clients. My &ldquo;trouble client&rdquo; classification is pretty diverse, in fact. I&rsquo;ve had people open up support tickets constantly. Some have no idea how to manage servers and ask for help on trivial tasks.

    (This is an old post from July 2012.) Attribution: Patrick Stahl This is just a quick configuration example to setup a “router-on-a-stick.” I’m using Vyatta for the router and a Brocade switch. I’ve changed the real addresses. Brocade switch configuration Ethernet 16 is the trunk port, in the Cisco lingo. It’s hooked up to the Vyatta router. It has to be tagged because we need to tag each frame with a VLAN ID so the switch knows where to send it.

    A few days ago, I was in the shower thinking about garbage collectors. I think some of my best ideas come from the shower, and I think it&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t have anything to distract me. I was thinking about easy it was to use the Hans Boehm garbage collector: Empirically, this collector works with most unmodified C programs, simply by replacing malloc with GC_malloc calls, replacing realloc with GC_realloc calls, and removing free calls.

    I started using Node.js a long time ago. It was the first time I saw async execution outside of the browser. It was cool &ndash; still is. I worked with Node internals for a significant part of a summer. It doesn&rsquo;t take long before you realize that the event loop is one of the most important components of Node. Node uses libuv for its evented I/O, and I sort of got into it, but not really.

After 5 years of service(rlshosting.com,easyhosting.pw), we are unable to provide service period and the backups were on the same datacenter too. We ran out of money and we cannot pay our server bills. Our Servers are suspended. You can believe what you want but we didn&rsquo;t spend your money for fun. It wasn&rsquo;t fun at all.

    Can you tell the difference between these two images? Click on them to see a full-size version. Hint: there is a difference, and it's font hinting! The first image has hinted text, and it's&nbsp;terrible!&nbsp;It's morphed. The dimensions are funky. Why destroy a perfectly fine typeface (created by&nbsp;artists) by hinting (using algorithms and fancy math)? I turn hinting off everywhere. I suggest you do it too. If you use Ubuntu, you can install Unity Tweak Tool: Sublime Text will still hint.

    On March 11th 2012, a Sunday, it was just past midnight and I was closing up tabs and getting ready to go to sleep. I had school the next day and I had already set myself up for less than 6 hours of sleep. My phone beeped to let me know that I had received an email. Usually it’s just a matter of taking a peek and archiving it. This one was a little different.

    At the beginning of the year, I told myself I would learn Go. Stuff about Go seems to pop up on the front page of Hacker News frequently. In fact, it’s gotten to the point where I think people upvote articles that mention Go in their titles. People really like it, or they just like talking about it. In any case, I think it’s worth trying out. I’ve been using Go for a few months now.

    I do many different things. When I was younger (around 11 years old), I used to make 3D models with Blender and play around with raytracing, caustics, bump maps, shaders, and all that good stuff. At the same time, I was getting into GNU/Linux, MySQL, and Apache. A few years later, I started playing guitar. Eventually, I became fascinated by cameras and photography. I also became the founder of a company.

    I just want to preface this by saying that I didn&rsquo;t make a draft before publishing this. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve written something so I just wanted to get something out as quickly as I could. I&rsquo;m expecting this post to be of a lower quality than usual. I remember my first GNU/Linux distribution years ago. It was Fedora Core 3. I think we still have the CDs back home.

    I sleep for 8 hours (overestimate). I intern for another 8. Since there are 24 hours in a day (right?), I&rsquo;m left with 8 hours. With those 8 hours, I need to eat, cook, go to the bathroom, brush my teeth, get around, and so on. Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; I&rsquo;m a university student, I&rsquo;m interning at a database startup, and I run a web hosting company. As a student, I&rsquo;m surrounded by people my age.

    Go sounds great. You can write concurrent programs using goroutines and channels without ever touching that callback nonsense, right? Yeah! I love FoundationDB. On the surface it’s extremely easy to use — it’s just a key-value store. All of the complexities are so well abstracted that you don’t have to worry about them. I wanted to try to use FoundationDB with Go. However, there’s no Go driver for it yet. I decided I should try to fix that.

    Remember my success equation? Success = potential + opportunities. I wanted to share my thoughts on potential. As I mentioned before, potential is everywhere in an academic setting. It&rsquo;s hard for me to not think about it. Potential is necessary for success. A simple example is a math test. You build up potential by studying the material, doing practice problems, and understanding key concepts. You&rsquo;re given the opportunity to succeed when you&rsquo;re given the test, and you&rsquo;ll succeed given that you had enough potential to do so.

    I&rsquo;ve been doing this for a few years now, and it&rsquo;s an interesting process. It&rsquo;s pretty much exactly what a thought experiment is: In its broadest usage, thought experimentation is the process of employing imaginary situations to help us understand the way things really are (or, in the case of Herman Kahn’s &ldquo;scenarios&rdquo;, understand something about something in the future). The understanding comes through reflection upon this imaginary situation. &ndash; Wikipedia In my &ldquo;thought experiments,&rdquo; which generally occur in the shower or when I&rsquo;m shaving, I assume I make a certain decision and then I fast forward into the future.

    It&rsquo;s May. I have a few finals left before I can say that I&rsquo;ve completed my first year of undergrad. You could say that I&rsquo;ve changed my mind a lot about what I wanted to accomplish over these four years, but you could also say that I haven&rsquo;t. As for my major, I think I&rsquo;ve landed on something. I want to major in mathematics. I applied to the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) at UVa, also known as the E-school.

    In computing, a context switch is the process of storing and restoring the state (context) of a process so that execution can be resumed from the same point at a later time. &ndash; Wikipedia Essentially, context switching means you stop what you&rsquo;re doing, do something else, and then go back to what you were originally doing. Context switching is important in computing, but it&rsquo;s also important for people. We do many different things in our lives, and that involves playing different roles.

    My first internship. In July 2011, I joined a company called 25K Digital as a software engineering intern. I just finished my junior year of high school, and I was excited. It was my first internship and I was ready to apply those impressive skills I had acquired over the years. I was ready to make some cool things! 25K Digital is a digital media agency. Most, if not all, of their work is client-based.

    My Thinkpad running Ubuntu 12.04 is my workhorse machine. I get most of my work done on it since my desktop is back home in Ashburn. Here&rsquo;s the thing about looking at good font rendering continuously: switching to a worse display gets really annoying really quickly. People have varying reasons why they don&rsquo;t use Windows or Mac OS X. I think I have a less common reason. It&rsquo;s not about usability or software compatibility.

    Early last month, I wrote Adversaria. I don&rsquo;t have a precise definition for it, but I like to think of it as a tool to store time series data in key-value format. It&rsquo;s really simple but useful. Using Adversaria and a little Flot magic, I make graphs like this: A few weeks ago, I decided to take it one step further. I felt that it was time to use whatever I learned to make that ad-hoc data storage solution to write a distributed key-value store.

    In 9th grade, our English teacher would assign us journal entries for homework. Sometimes we had prompts, but usually we would have the option of writing whatever we wanted. Poetry, short stories, haikus, whatever. I remember writing about my handwriting a few times. It&rsquo;s interesting. I noticed in middle school that my handwriting always changed somehow after summer vacation. My handwriting would even change as I wrote a journal entry. I wrote about that too.

    Here&rsquo;s a simple example of how to use a C library from Go. I made a small library called libfoo. libfoo.c #include &quot;libfoo.h&quot; int foo() { return 1; } libfoo.h int foo(); Of course, you have to compile that as a shared object with GCC. $ gcc -shared libfoo.c -o libfoo.so Make sure you copy over the binary to /usr/lib/ and copy the header to /usr/include/. The Go file. package main /* #cgo LDFLAGS: -lfoo #include &lt;libfoo/libfoo.h&gt; */ import &quot;C&quot; import &quot;fmt&quot; func main() { fmt.Println(&quot;From libfoo: &quot;, C.foo()) } &hellip;and that&rsquo;s it.

    As I mentioned in this post, I think success is the product of both potential and opportunity. I&rsquo;ve started noticing people with great potential who struggle to succeed because they don&rsquo;t receive the necessary opportunities. It&rsquo;s annoying to think about, but there&rsquo;s not much to do about it. Given enough potential, it&rsquo;s not hard to find opportunities. I think sometimes opportunities just come to you. That&rsquo;s what it feels like to me.

    I put racing stripes back on my guitars. I took them off temporarily because I messed up the first time and didn&rsquo;t bother to replace them. Why the stripes? I&rsquo;m not sure. I&rsquo;m definitely not the first to put stripes on a guitar. I haven&rsquo;t seen many others do it though. Still, I think they look nice. Suddenly a couple of strips of black electrical tape make these guitars mine. I can look at them for a millisecond and tell that they&rsquo;re my guitars.

    Everyone (or almost everyone) uses RRDtool to store traffic data. I wanted something a little different. Couchbase woes! I started using Couchbase to log traffic. I had a document for each data point and was able to run map-reduce queries with Couchbase views. It worked great for a couple of months and then for some reason&hellip; weird stuff happened. Over 5,000 documents stopped getting mapped. That&rsquo;s not good. I used a 4-node Couchbase cluster, because why not?

    Alright. This is the what&hellip; third or fourth time I started over? There’s a reason why I call this blog misframe. I’m constantly framing (or planning) poorly and doing things wrong in general. That’s not bad, though. I love what I do. I love being annoyed at things. Seeing exactly why things don’t work convinces me better than anyone else could. Tumblr, don’t let me down!
