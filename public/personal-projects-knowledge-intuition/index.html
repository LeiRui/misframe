    <p>I had a short conversation with someone recently about having personal projects and applying to internships. The short version of what he said is,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do my school work well and good grades. Besides that, I also do well during internships. Why do I need personal projects?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(The following represent my own views. This is a personal blog after all, and this is just, like, my opinion, man.)</p>

<hr />

<p>Just for fun, I did a quick search on personal projects to see what kind of links would show up.
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/FcmrHYL.png" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Design, photography, and art. I was not surprised. I predicted that photography would show up. When people look for individuals for some sort of artistic or creative position, I think they&rsquo;re always looking for some sort of portfolio. If you&rsquo;re just getting started &ndash; perhaps as an intern &ndash; your portfolio would only have personal projects. I think portfolios show skill, personality, and experience. How else could you get those?</p>

<hr />

<p>For a student who does not have personal projects, are school work and past work the only significant things one can look at? I am very opinionated against school work. I don&rsquo;t think learning about programming in school will make you a good programmer. And past work or past internships? I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how useful this information is.</p>

<p>People might talk about how personal projects on GitHub are a demonstration of skill, work ethic, and other good things. I don&rsquo;t necessarily disagree, but there is more to it! It&rsquo;s not just about programming. Being able to get work done correctly and efficiently is how we judge machines. This is about people. Personal projects are your own. They&rsquo;re a part of your personality. They&rsquo;re something you care about. Of all the things you could be doing, you choose to work on them. What keeps you going when no one else is looking tells a lot about who you are.</p>

<p>Over the years I think I&rsquo;ve come to realize that what separates the great programmers from the rest is the fact that the former know more about what <em>not</em> to do. They&rsquo;ve done it all, and they know what doesn&rsquo;t work. Everyone makes mistakes, but usually they happen once or twice. The great programmers go about with the experience of many mistakes. The beginners don&rsquo;t, and the only way to change that is to make lots of mistakes. Personal projects are <em>perfect</em> for them. There&rsquo;s no risk! A friend once told me that interns are either an asset or a liability. People who have made many mistakes (<em>and</em> learned from them) are great assets in my opinion.</p>

<p>I think the <em>most important</em> aspect of personal projects is that they increase one&rsquo;s intuition. There&rsquo;s knowledge &ndash; knowing something, how it works, and so on. I think there&rsquo;s a layer above that which is knowing <em>why</em> something works. And then I like to believe there&rsquo;s a layer above that which is rather difficult to explain. It&rsquo;s like understanding at a very deep level. I call it intuition, but that may be the wrong word here. I like to credit all of my interesting ideas to this intuition.</p>

<hr />

<p>A few weeks ago, I learned about <a href="http://hackcville.com/">HackCville</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://januaryterm.splashthat.com/">Land A Startup Internship</a> course. I don&rsquo;t like this for many reasons, but I&rsquo;ll focus on the following taken from their site:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Learn about the importance of side projects and how to start them.</strong></p>

<p>Side projects demonstrate self-directed learning and curiosity that will set you apart from your peers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, side projects (or personal projects, as I refer to them) are very important. I don&rsquo;t like the fact that someone would start a personal project to land an interview. That&rsquo;s not genuine. I think there&rsquo;s something wrong if you need to fake who you are or what you do to get the opportunities that you want. I also want to say that a quality like that isn&rsquo;t just unhelpful, but perhaps even negative.</p>

<hr />

<p>I take personal projects seriously, and I think they&rsquo;re <em>very</em> important for college students who don&rsquo;t have a lot of professional experience. There are <em>many</em> computer science students at UVA, and they&rsquo;re all basically learning the same things. The interesting students have exciting projects that they work on and like to talk about. The others are, well, kind of boring. Sometimes it&rsquo;s fine to be boring :).</p>

<p>Thanks to Abi for reading a draft of this.</p>
