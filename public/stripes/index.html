<p>I put racing stripes back on my guitars. I took them off temporarily because I messed up the first time and didn&rsquo;t bother to replace them.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.misfra.me/images/guitars_stripes.jpg" alt="Capella and Vega" />
</p>

<h2 id="why-the-stripes:0ca259718d61c42a9224a7829e172229">Why the stripes?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure. I&rsquo;m definitely not the first to put stripes on a guitar. I haven&rsquo;t seen many others do it though. Still, I think they look nice. Suddenly a couple of strips of black electrical tape make these guitars <em>mine.</em> I can look at them for a millisecond and tell that they&rsquo;re my guitars. It&rsquo;s nice.</p>

<h2 id="names:0ca259718d61c42a9224a7829e172229">Names</h2>

<p>A friend of mine named his guitar. I thought that was interesting, but I didn&rsquo;t think it was weird. Steve Vai names his guitars, but I think he has to since he has so many of them. My guitar was given a name, for some reason. I didn&rsquo;t think much of it, and eventually agreed to a couple of names given by another friend. The names haven&rsquo;t changed since. The S is called Capella and the RG is Vega.</p>

<p>At first I thought it was silly to have guitar named after stars. Mentally the names just stuck. Then something interesting started to happen: I looked at my guitars and saw Capella and Vega&ndash;not an S and an RG. At the same time, I started to notice the subtle differences between the two. It&rsquo;s hard to explain. They have their own&hellip; personalities, as Steve Vai would put it.</p>

<p>Capella&rsquo;s awesome. By far one of the best instruments I&rsquo;ve played. It&rsquo;s incredibly comfortable to play. I really like how thin it is. It&rsquo;s not light, thanks to the mahogany. The ZR tremolo is perfect. This guitar lets me do whatever I want. It looks great too!</p>

<p>Vega&rsquo;s a challenge. It&rsquo;s getting older. The pickguard is turning yellowish due to exposure to the sun. There are a few more nicks in the paint from just normal &ldquo;wear and tear.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s bigger, but weighs as much as Capella. Its Edge 3 pisses me off <em>all the time.</em> It&rsquo;s a challenge, but it&rsquo;s still fun to play.</p>

<h2 id="going-to-guitar-center:0ca259718d61c42a9224a7829e172229">Going to Guitar Center</h2>

<p>When you first start off playing an instrument, you&rsquo;re stuck with something cheap. It&rsquo;s not a bad thing, since you&rsquo;re not left with an empty wallet if you realize that it&rsquo;s not for you. Once you get better, though, it becomes a limit.</p>

<p>Something interesting happened to me about four years ago. I wanted to buy a guitar. I had an electric from many years ago that I stopped playing, and I had a classical guitar that had been using for the past two years for school. I knew that I was serious about playing guitar. So I walked into Guitar Center, picked up a Gibson SG, and started to play. Boom. I was playing&hellip; better. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. How could picking up a better guitar make me play better?</p>

<h2 id="tools-and-limits:0ca259718d61c42a9224a7829e172229">Tools and limits</h2>

<p>A guitar is just a tool. It just helps you do what you need to do. Cameras are like that too. So are pens. There comes a point where a better tool isn&rsquo;t going to help you get better at something. At that point, the tool isn&rsquo;t the limit anymore. It&rsquo;s you.</p>

<p>I went back to Guitar Center the other day for the first time in months, if not years. Every guitar I picked up was just&hellip; another guitar. I&rsquo;m not playing any better. If anything, I&rsquo;m playing <em>worse</em> since they feel different from what I play at home. The only thing that&rsquo;s going to make me play better is more practice and more effort.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great feeling to know that you&rsquo;re not limited by anything except for yourself.</p>
