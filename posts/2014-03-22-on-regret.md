A few years ago, one of the things I decided to do was to live without regret.

I never say, "I wish I had done ..." or "I shouldn't have ..." If you should have done something, why didn't you do it? If you, through reason, choose to do something you believe is the *best* choice, why would you have to regret it in the future? You did nothing wrong! If you didn't choose the best option, well, that's something to fix.

Keep in mind that sometimes there are no right answers.
